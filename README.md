# Game Development Senior Project - University of Florida

Welcome to the repository for the game project, _Nightfall_, developed by Ethan Fiore in Spring 2024 for CIS4914 (Senior Project) at the University of Florida.

## About the Game
This project is a 2D top-down action RPG where the player embarks on a heroic journey through lands plagued by enemy skeletons. Will you be able to vanquish the monsters and save the world?

## Development Details
After developing the Nightfall demo in Spring 2022 (play at https://github.com/ethanfire/NightfallDemo), I really wanted to make it into a full game. This game greatly expands on the combat, enemy AI, and scope of the first game, boasting 3 different weapon classes (each with multiple tiers), 2 magic attacks, 4 unique enemy types (with regional variants), and 3 bosses to finish off the 3 regions to explore.

As with the first game, revisiting and developing a full Nightfall game came with many lessons. I wanted to develop new and smart enemy AI, which I did by using a state machine and giving them different abilities, similar to what the player has. I also wanted to make very large maps for the player to explore and fight these new enemies, and I certainly pushed the engine to its limits of what tilesets could be (without getting into chunk loading strategies). Switching from Unity to Godot for this game was a hard choice, but I believe that undergoing the learning process for a whole new engine was very valuable towards my software development skills. Going from C++ and C# to Godot's GDScript was definitely hard at first, but the community help and the tools of the language make it very much worth the work. Utilizing version control was a must this time around (and I _almost_ had to learn that the hard way).
